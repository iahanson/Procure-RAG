OVERVIEW:

The Procurement Act 2023, officially enacted on October 26, 2023, marks a significant change in the UK's public procurement system. This legislation is set to come into effect from October 2024, preceded by a six-month notice period to ensure a smooth transition.

Changes in Procurement Objectives

Under the Act, there are notable shifts in procurement objectives. Previously, authorities were bound to treat economic operators equally and transparently, following directives from Europe. However, the Act introduces new priorities, including maximizing value for money, enhancing public benefits, and maintaining integrity in all procurement activities.

Flexible Procurement Procedures

Contracting authorities now have more flexibility in designing procurement procedures. They can opt for

a single-stage open procedure; or
choose a competitive flexible procedure, which allows for multiple stages, including deselection and shortlisting, and criteria refinement.
Treatment of Suppliers

The Act emphasizes fair treatment of suppliers, unless justifiable differences exist that do not disadvantage any party unfairly. This change reflects the Act's aim of introducing greater flexibility into the procurement process.

Enhanced Transparency

To increase transparency, the Act introduces several new requirements for publishing notices throughout the procurement lifecycle. These include

planned procurement notices,
pipeline notices,
transparency notices for direct contract awards,
mandatory contracts change notices, and
termination notices.
Changes in Contract Award Process

Under the Act, the standstill period before entering into a contract is reduced to 8 working days from the publication of the contract award notice. However, exceptions apply in cases of extreme urgency or when contracts are awarded through frameworks.

Introduction of the Open Framework

A notable addition is the introduction of the Open Framework, which spans 8 years. This framework allows for the addition of suppliers during the contract duration, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

These changes aim to streamline the procurement process, increase transparency, and promote fair treatment of all stakeholders involved.

THE DELIVERY TEAM:

The Strategic Procurement Team are facilitating the organisational transition. The team will work closely with Procurement and Contract Managers across the Council, along with colleagues in Finance, Governance, Legal and the Bi-Borough Procurement Service. Further information and ongoing updates will be available via the Strategic Procurement SharePoint and Yammer Pages soon. 

What do we want to achieve?

In preparation for the reforms, we are focussing on four areas where early consideration and action will allow RBKC to be in the best shape to hit the ground running:
 

Processes and Policies – ensuring procurement processes and policies are robust and fit for purpose.

Systems – ensuring procurement systems are capable of meeting the new requirements.

People – considering the procurement and contracting capabilities across the organisation and identifying who needs to attend the training sessions.

Transition – ensuring the central contract register is up to date, and we have a centralised pipeline of procurement activity over the next 18 months.

WHAT DO WE NEED FROM YOU?

In order to transition successfully, the Strategic Procurement team needs your ongoing support and cooperation. We are currently gathering the following information:
 

The names of Procurement and Contract Managers in your department who will require training on the new regulations and access to the new e-Tendering portal. Because the laws are changing so significantly a centralised list of trained practitioners will be held in Strategic Procurement to ensure the Council is not exposed to risk by untrained officers attempting procurement.
 

A list of the active contracts in place in your department. As we need to know that we have the skills and resource to support you in all the upcoming contract renewals you have and must publish a pipeline of all upcoming work to the Cabinet Office under the new regulations.
 

A list of the procurement projects planned over the next 18 months. As we need to know that we have the skills and resource to support you in all the upcoming contract renewals you have and must publish a pipeline of all upcoming work to the Cabinet Office under the new regulations.

TRAINING:

Knowledge Drops

The government has launched the first of its official training resources to help professionals get to grips with the Procurement Act 2023, expected to be in force in October 2024. These are known as “knowledge drops”.

Who are they for? 

Those who have regular interactions with procurement and would need some material level of understanding of the new legislation, such as: 

senior leaders at executive or political level
finance people
commissioners of services
non-procurement people who regularly interact with tender processes or manage suppliers, contracts or works
lawyers who do not specialise in procurement
procurement helpdesk and systems people
people who will implement reporting changes
suppliers 
Duration and how to access the learning?



In addition to the legislative changes, the Strategic Procurement Team will implement a new e-Tendering portal to replace Capital eSourcing early this year, which will no longer be used after June 2024, though anything live at the end of June will be able to be delivered to completion This will ensure that the Council is capable procuring contracts in compliance with the new legislation, and capable of fulfilling the new, complicated transparency requirements throughout the contract lifecycle.
